## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A web server supporting PHP 7.4 or higher.
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript, PHP, and web development.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dynamic-website-builder.git
cd dynamic-website-builder
```


2. **Set up your server** to point to the `index.php` file (e.g., using Apache or Nginx).

3. **Upload the project files** to your web server.

4. **Customize `basePath` in `main.js`** to match your installation path:

```js
const basePath = "/your/path/"; // Set this to match your site's root.
```


5. **Visit your site** in a browser, and enjoy smooth transitions and easy content management.

## üìÑ Usage

### Adding a New Page:
- Create a new PHP file in the `/pages` directory.
- Define your page content inside the `.content` element.
- Update the title and meta tags within the file.
- The new page will be automatically picked up by the navigation menu.

### Custom CSS or JS for Each Page:

- Simply add a CSS or JS file in the `/css` or `/js` folders with the same name as the PHP file in the `/pages` directory.
- Example: For `about.php`, add `about.css` in the `/css` folder or `about.js` in the `/js` folder.
- `versions.php` will automatically detect and update the version based on the file modification date.

### Page Template Structure:

Each page in the /pages folder should follow this minimal structure:

```html
<!-- This is an example page, other pages should follow this structure -->
<title>Page Title</title>
<meta name="description" content="Page description goes here.">
<meta name="keywords" content="keyword1, keyword2, keyword3">
<div class="content">
    <h1>Page Heading</h1>
    <p>This is the content of the page. It will be dynamically loaded.</p>
</div>
```

Note: There is no need for a full HTML structure (like <html>, <head>, or <body> tags). The template focuses on the content and metadata, which are automatically integrated into the main layout.

## üé® Customization

- Modify the **blinds effect** in `main.js` to adjust transition speed or create a different animation.
- Adjust styles in `mobile.css` and `desktop.css` to customize the look and feel of your site for different devices.
- Extend the `versions.php` logic to include more asset types or additional data if needed.
